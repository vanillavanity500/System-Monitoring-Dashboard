This is a Python system monitoring dashboard that collects and visualizes system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. It includes features 
such as real-time alerts via email notifications, historical data storage, and error handling/logging.

Key Features:

Continuously monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage of the system.
Sends emails whenever critical limits are hit (low memory, high CPU usage, etc).
Stores system metrics in a CSV file for trend analysis.
Carries out error handling and logging to track system performance and troubleshoot issues.
Automates execution using cron jobs to run the monitoring script at predefined intervals every 3 hours.
